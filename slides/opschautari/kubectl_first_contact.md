# Kubernetes first contact 

- In this section we explore different ways to explore kubernetes resource.

- Configure our machines so we could talk to kubernetes

- Quick deploy some apps and browse it ;)

---

## Kubernetes | Client

- Talking is kubernetes is just like:

   - sending HTTP request to the kubernetes apiserver

   - query or update some resources stored on etcd
  
--

- and we use the clients:

   - official client is `kubectl`

   - options: there are other awesome cli tools like: [k9s](https://k9scli.io/)

   - or gui: [kubernetes-dashboard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/), [k8slens](https://k8slens.dev/)

## kubectl this || kubectl that...

- Installing:
  - straight forward 
  - ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/ 
  
.exercise[
- grab the binary from upstream release  
```bash
VERSION=$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)
curl -LO "https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/${VERSION}/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
```
- copy it to system path && make it executable 
```bash
install -m 755 kubectl -t /usr/local/bin/
```
- see it working
```bash
kubectl version
```
]

## kubectl this || kubectl that...

you might see a msg with client version info:
```json
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"20", GitVersion:"v1.20.2", GitCommit:"faecb196815e248d3ecfb03c680a4507229c2a56", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2021-01-13T13:28:09Z", GoVersion:"go1.15.5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
The connection to the server localhost:8080 was refused -
...did you specify the right host or port?
```

No need of worry its okay, that is kubectl telling you, it can't find k8s server, its because we haven't put config file yet !!

ðŸŽŠ cheers, kubectl is installed ðŸŽŠ lets move to configuration part.

---
## kubectl this || kubectl that...
- Configuring:

  - telling kubectl where your server(s) is/are located
  - how to authenticate to k8s api(s)
--

- Sample skeleton: 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config

clusters: [...]  # cluster{ ca-auth-data:xxx, server:url }, name:blah 
users:    [...]  # user{exec:...|| username,password || token}, name:johndoe
contexts: [...]  # context{ cluster:blah, namespace:xxx, user:yyy }, name:zzz
...
```

ðŸ—’ If you are using civo, download the Kubeconfig file from the dashboard and save it as `~/.kube/config`
